This web-site is to help developers collect there work in a single easy to use format.

And to be able in a few clicks see syntax differences in the languages, and copy and paste
the code as needed.
Instead of struggling with was this language
if []; then

fi
or was it???
if () {

}
I have found this to be the most frustrating part of cross programming! So I created this
program to solve that very problem.

All that you have to do is upload your file or directory with files in them according to 
	the computer language that you using.

This is not meant for Production use!
This software is for Development Servers (aka Home Server, Personal Office Server).

This program is in prototyping until further notice.

The idea of the program is to add as many simple examples in a numbered format.
	After that, all the examples can be label as to function or title.
	
The program has a built in search engine. 
	It will open and search for a word or phrase that you are looking for,
		it will display the line number(s),
		display the line,
		and a link to that page.
	NOTES: The search does NOT search the whole site at one time, ONLY individual languages, one at a time. 
			* For example to search for the function ""else"" in PHP, you first have to click on PHP, to
			* search for PHP functions.
	
	# Still in design for multi-directories.

To create a page just simple the 0000_Blank??? page to see the format
The Word ''Description'' is very important and is used as a descriptor on the left side of the program
	I would suggest refraining from using any special characters in your description to avoid any of them being erased.
	Example when Using the word Description if you use a : like Description: it will erase the :
	if you use // Description it will erase the //
	if you use # Description it will erase the #
	
If you add a directory it will recognize it but search will not search it, (just for now...)

If you add a picture it will show up as a link and will be displayed, this is good for schematics too.
	file formats are: .jpg .jpeg .png .gif

If a directory does not exist it will not display the computer language.
	Example I only program in PHP,BASH,JavaScript,and HTML.
	If only 4 folders are present that at the top links it will display.
	Bash JavaScript HTML PHP
	you will not see languages that you do not use, as log as the directory/folder does not exist.
	
If you add a Video to the folder '''videos''' and the programming language
	example PHP video add to '''videos/\php
	In your source code type in:
	Location_of_the_video: nameofvideo.mp4
	and it will play the video when you enter that page.
	* file formats are .mp4 .flv
	
last news neither Web_Site_For_Video: Meta_data_for_YouTube: are not working get it to work soon.
