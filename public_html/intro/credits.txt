We hope that you are enjoying this open source program. Just because it's free to use, does not mean that it is free to develop the program.

This program has taken many years to think up, develop, and test. I have worked many hours creating this program to help the general community. By creating this help program it, fills a niche. When ever you want to search for a simple example of a program, you will notice that the leading search engines are focused on selling you something.

The idea of a free and open source internet, is slipping through our fingers. If it's not profitable it's not worth a company to create it.
